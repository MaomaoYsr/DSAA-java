Data structures and algorithms in java

## bubble sort ##

First designed in 2023-02 and updated in 03.

## An example  ##

Array length: 5

Please input numbers in array:

2 3 4 5 4

The array before Bubblesort: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

- Cuz 2 < || = 3, so 1 and 2 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]
- Cuz 3 < || = 4, so 2 and 3 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]
- Cuz 4 < || = 5, so 3 and 4 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]
- Cuz 5 > 4, so 4 and 5 change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

The 1st turn result: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

- Cuz 2 < || = 3, so 1 and 2 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
- Cuz 3 < || = 4, so 2 and 3 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
- Cuz 4 < || = 4, so 3 and 4 do not change place. Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

The 2nd turn result: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

After sorting, the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

There was only 1 change made in this array.
