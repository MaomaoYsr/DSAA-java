## bubble sort ##
First designed in 2023-02, updated in March 03

## An example (in terminal) ##
Array length: 5
Please input numbers in the array: 2 3 4 5 4
The array before Bubble Sort: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Because 2 < || = 3, position 1 and 2 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Because 3 < || = 4, position 2 and 3 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Because 4 < || = 5, position 3 and 4 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Because 5 > 4, position 4 and 5 swap places. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

The result of the 1st turn: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Because 2 < || = 3, position 1 and 2 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Because 3 < || = 4, position 2 and 3 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Because 4 < || = 4, position 3 and 4 do not change place. 
Now the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

The result of the 2nd turn: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

After sorting, the array is: [2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Total of 1 swap occurred during the sorting process.
